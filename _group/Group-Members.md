##### Chang Liu
Chang Liu's research work lies in an intersection between fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamical system, control theory and optimization. His current interested topic in fluid dynamics include double-diffusive convection, wall-bounded shear flows, stratified shear flows, shallow water waves and vortex-induced vibrations. His main research tools employed to understand fluid dynamics include bifurcation analysis, robust control theory, semi-definite optimization, adaptive filtering, asymptotic analysis and direct numerical simulations.
